# Stection 5 : EC2 Basics

EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud ( Infrastructure as a Service )
* It mainly consists in the capability of :
• Renting virtual machines (EC2)
• Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
• Distributing load across machines (ELB)
• Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)


EC2 sizing & configuration options 
• Operating System (OS): Linux, Windows or Mac OS 
• How much compute power & cores (CPU) 
• How much random-access memory (RAM)
• How much storage space: 
    • Network-attached (EBS & EFS) 
    • hardware (EC2 Instance Store) 
• Network card: speed of the card, Public IP address 
• Firewall rules: security group 
• Bootstrap script (configure at first launch): EC2 User Data 

EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as:
• Installing updates
• Installing software
• Downloading common files from the internet
• Anything you can think of


# EC2 Instance Types 
Example : 
m5.2xlarge

• m: instance class
• 5: generation (AWS improves them over time)
• 2xlarge: size within the instance class

# General Purpose
# compute Optimized
# Memory Optimized
# Accelerated computing
# storage Optimized
# Instance Features
# Measuring Instance

# Instance  vCPU  Mem(GiB) Storage            NetworPerformance  EBS Bandwidth(Mbps)
* t2.micro    1   1       EBS-Only            Low to Moderate
* t2.xlarge   4   16      EBS-Only            Moderate
* c5d.4xlarge 16  32      1 x 400 NVMe SSD    Up to 10 Gbps       4,750
* r5.16xlarge 64  512     EBS Only            20 Gbps             13,600
* m5.8xlarge  32  128     EBS Only            10 Gbps             6,800


# Security Group
• Security Groups are the fundamental of network security in AWS
• They control how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 Instances.
• Security groups only contain rules
• Security groups rules can reference by IP or by security group
• Security groups are acting as a “firewall” on EC2 instances 
    • They regulate: 
    • Access to Ports 
    • Authorised IP ranges – IPv4 and IPv6 
    • Control of inbound network (from other to the instance) 
    • Control of outbound network (from the instance to other)

Can be attached to multiple instances
• Locked down to a region / VPC combination
• Does live “outside” the EC2 – if traffic is blocked the EC2 instance won’t see it
• It’s good to maintain one separate security group for SSH access
• If your application is not accessible (time out), then it’s a security group issue
• If your application gives a “connection refused“ error, then it’s an application
error or it’s not launched
• All inbound traffic is blocked by default
• All outbound traffic is authorised by default 

• 22    = SSH (Secure Shell) - log into a Linux instance
• 21    = FTP (File Transfer Protocol) – upload files into a file share
• 22    = SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) – upload files using SSH
• 80    = HTTP – access unsecured websites
• 443   = HTTPS – access secured websites
• 3389  = RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) – log into a Windows instance

# Public IP:
• Public IP means the machine can be identified on the internet (WWW)
• Must be unique across the whole web (not two machines can have the same public IP).
• Can be geo-located easily
# Private IP:
• Private IP means the machine can only be identified on a private network only
• The IP must be unique across the private network
• BUT two different private networks (two companies) can have the same IPs.
• Machines connect to WWW using a NAT + internet gateway (a proxy)
• Only a specified range of IPs can be used as private IP
# Elastic IPs
• When you stop and then start an EC2 instance, it can change its public IP.
• If you need to have a fixed public IP for your instance, you need and Elastic IP
• An Elastic IP is a public IPv4 IP you own as long as you don’t delete it
• You can attach it to one instance at a time .
• With an Elastic IP address, you can mask the failure of an instance or software
by rapidly remapping the address to another instance in your account.
• You can only have 5 Elastic IP in your account (you can ask AWS to increase
that).

# Placement Groups
Ec2 placement strategy
# Cluster
• clusters instances into a low-latency group in a single Availability Zone
# Spread
• spreads instances across underlying hardware (max 7 instances per group per AZ)
# Partition
• spreads instances across many different partitions (which rely on different sets of racks) within an AZ. Scales to 100s of EC2 instances per group (Hadoop, Cassandra, Kafka)

# Elastic Network Interfaces (ENI)
