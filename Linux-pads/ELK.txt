ELK - Elastic Sreach ,Logstash and Kibana
What is Elasticsearch ?
Elasticsearch is a NoSQL database. 
It is based on the Lucene search engine as a inverted Text Data struchture and it is built with RestFul APIs


It is main used for Storing ,searching and Managing 
-logs
-searching data in backend applications

It mainly consist of 
- Indexes - similar to Databases 
- Documents - Rows - JSON objects
- Fields - columns
---------------------------------------------
ELK 

E stands for Elastic Search : It is NoSql DataBase tool , which is used to store the unstructed data .It is used for storing Logs,
L Stands for LogStash : It is used for both shipping as well as the processing  and storing logs.
                        it will take input from dii=fferent sources and performs various transformations on it , 
                        and it will exports the data into  various targets
K Stands for Kibana : kibana is a data visualization tool , which provieds an interactive UI to users for data Visualization


ELK stack Architecture 

ELK stack is designed to allow users to take data from any source ,in format and to search,analyze and visualize that data.
Application-----> kafka --> logstash---->elastic sreach ---> Kibana bashborad
1. Applications logs which 
2. Logstash : collect logs and events data ,it transform data. (Data Processing  --> Like csv files )
3. Elastic Search : The transfromed data from logstash is store, search and Indexed.(Sreach Anynatics)
4. kibana: kibana uses Elastic search DB to Explore ,visulaize the data on interactive UI.

Appilcation logs(kafaka) ---> logstash(data processing)----> elastic sreach(storage) ---> Kibana (visualize)

Q. What is a document in ElasticSearch
The document is very similar to a row in relational databases. 
Every document in the index possess different structure but has the same data type for respective fields.

MySQL => Databases => Tables => Columns/Rows
ElasticSearch => Indices => Types => Documents with Properties
===============================================================================
Q. What is a Cluster in Elasticsearch?
Cluster is a collection of single or multiple nodes that holds your entire data and offers
federated indexing and search abilities across all nodes.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What is a replica in ElasticSearch?
Each shard in ElasticSearch has 2 copy, which is called replicas. 
They help you for high-availability and fault-tolerance.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What Are The Main Operations You Can Perform On A Document?
Here, are important operation performed on documents:
1. Indexing a document
2. Fetching documents
3. Updating documents
4. Deleting documents
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. How you can delete an index in Elastic search?
To delete an index in Elasticsearch, You need to write command:
> DELETE /index name.
For example, DELETE /website.

Q. How can you create an Index in Elasticsearch?
For example:
> PUT /client?pretty
> GET /_cat/indices?v

Q. Explain the method to add a mapping in an Index
Elasticsearch allows you to create the mapping according to the data provided by the user in the request body. 
Its bulk feature can be used to add more than one JSON object in the index.
> For example :  POST website /_bulk.
